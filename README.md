# color-transition-emotion-experiment
This experiment aims to assess which emotions are evoked during color transitions. Color transition is the process in which a surface's color is replaced by another color. 

#Purposes
Recent studies revealed the property of fixed and isolated color on triggering various emotions in human. However, in real-life situations, we switch our vision
dynamically across colorful targets, which causes color transitions (CT). Hence, it raises a question on how the emotion affected by these transitions, which hasn’t
been examined by any previous researches. Therefore, my research aimed to investigate the mentioned problem to determine:
- The existence of emotions that evoked by CT.
- The effect of pair-work on triggering emotion during CT.
The result of this research can be applied to orientate audience’s emotion in art, film making, marketing, fashion, concerts, public events, etc.
